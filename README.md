Go to **"Network Security Groups"** ‚ûú pick one of the NSGs attached a target VM.

Go to the **"NSG flow logs"** blade ‚ûú and click on the **"Create flow log"** button:

<br>

First ‚ûú make sure the **Target VMs are Running**.

<br>

> **<summary> üí° Note</summary>**
> 
> The Microsoft Defender will:

<br>

Next ‚ûú go to our Log Analytics Workspacethe

Inside the **"Agents"** blade ‚ûú click on the **"Data Collection Rules"** button

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075f495e-6c91-4b9a-996e-ebadfd86db66)

<br>

We'll then **"Create data collection rule"**:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075f495e-6c91-4b9a-996e-ebadfd86db66)

<br>

We'll create the New Data Collection Rule with the following details:
- **Rule Name**: ```dcr-all-vms``` ‚ûú üí° this stands for 1 single DCR that will apply to all of our VMs
- **Resource group**: ```RG-Cyber-Lab```
- **Region**: ```East US``` ‚ûú ‚ö†Ô∏è make sure you put it in the **Same Region as you Target VMs**, otherwise it won't work!
- **Platform Type**: ‚¶ø **All**

Then click **"Next"** to reach the **Resources** tab:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075f495e-6c91-4b9a-996e-ebadfd86db66)

<br>

For the Resources we're going to ‚ûï **Add Resources**:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075f495e-6c91-4b9a-996e-ebadfd86db66)

<br>

Now expand the **> RG-Cyber Lab** Resource Group ‚ûú and select ‚òëÔ∏è for both of our VMs ‚ûú click **"Apply"**:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075f495e-6c91-4b9a-996e-ebadfd86db66)

<br>

Click **"Next: Collect and deliver >"**

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075f495e-6c91-4b9a-996e-ebadfd86db66)

<br>

üí° This is where we'll specify which Logs from within the VMs we're going to collect.

So we'll click on the ‚ûï **Add data source** button:

We'll do the **"Linux Syslog"** first.

In this Lab, the only Logs we're going to Collect from the Linux VM are the ```LOG_AUTH``` Logs.

<br>

>   <details close> 
>   
> **<summary> üí° </summary>**
>   
> The AUTH LOGS are the Logs we inspected earlier ‚ûú where we saw all the **SSH Failure Attempts**.

> For the data source settings, when selecting the **"Minimum log level"** ‚ûú this signifies the level of logging we want to collect:
> 
> DEBUG essentially means "collect everything", and then in kind of scales down towards EMERG which means "only collect critical logs".
> 
>   </details>

<br>

So for **LOG_AUTH** ‚ûú leave the **"Minimum log level"** at ```LOG_DEBUG``` ‚ûú meaning we'll collect all the Auth Logs.

And then we'll select ```LOG_DEBUG``` for the rest of the Log Types.

After setting that up ‚ûú click on the **"Next : Destination"** button:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075f495e-6c91-4b9a-996e-ebadfd86db66)

<br>

For **Destination** ‚ûú make sure you're sending the data to your actual **LAW**, not the random one that was created! ‚ö†Ô∏è

Click **"Add data source"**:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075f495e-6c91-4b9a-996e-ebadfd86db66)

<br>

Now click on the ‚ûï **Add data source** button again:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075f495e-6c91-4b9a-996e-ebadfd86db66)

<br>

The next one is going to be **"Windows Event Logs"**.

<br>

>   <details close> 
>   
> **<summary> üí° </summary>**
>   
> This might be hard to remember, but back when we were configuring SQL logging for the SQL Server Database ‚ûú  the SQL Logs appeared on the Application Event Log ‚ûú under Information
> 
> And then for Security ‚ûú  Audit Success & Audit Failure ‚ûú  this is when someone tries to Remote Desktop into our Windows VM or tries to Map a File Share.
> 
>   </details>

<br>

We're going to select the ‚òëÔ∏è **Information** Logs from **"Application"** type.

And also select the ‚òëÔ∏è **Audit Success** & ‚òëÔ∏è **Audit Failure** Logs from the **"Security"** type.

<br>

<br>

We'll go back to our **Log Analytics Wokspace** ‚ûú click on the **"Agents"** blade ‚ûú and then on the **"Data Collection Rules"** Button.

Click on the Data Collection Rule that we just created ‚ûú ```dcr-all-vms```

Then we'll go to the **"Data Sources"** blade ‚ûú and click on the **"Windows Event Logs"** Data Source:

This time instead of **"Basic"** we'll go to **"Custom"**.

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075f495e-6c91-4b9a-996e-ebadfd86db66)

<br>

We want to configure our **Data Collection Rule** so that:

<br>

‚ù∂ If Malware is discovered ‚ûú a Log is created and it's forwarded into our **LAW**.

<br>

Copy the following **Windows Defender Malware Detection XPath Query**:

<br>

```commandline
Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational!*[System[(EventID=1116 or EventID=1117)]]
```
<br>

And now add it to the **Add Data Source Section**.

<br>

‚ù∑ Also if the Firewall is disabled or messed with ‚ûú we want the **Firewall Logs** to be forwarded to our **LAW** as well.

<br>

Copy the following **Windows Firewall Tampering Detection XPath Query**:

<br>

```commandline
Microsoft-Windows-Windows Firewall With Advanced Security/Firewall!*[System[(EventID=2003)]]
```
<br>

Again ‚ûú we'll add it to the **Add data source** section.

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075f495e-6c91-4b9a-996e-ebadfd86db66)

<br>

Click **"Save"** and we've successfully configured our Data Collection Rule with "Special Forwarding" ‚úÖ

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

<br>

This is all we need for the **Windows Event Logs** ‚ûú so then we'll click on **"Next : Destination"**:

Once again ‚ûú for **Destination** ‚ûú we need to make sure we put our actual LAW ```LAW-Cyber-Lab-01```.

Then Add the data source:

We can now **"Review + create"** to Create the Data Collection Rule:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42c1fe46-b2c3-4330-8a86-bd32748cb890)

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42c1fe46-b2c3-4330-8a86-bd32748cb890)

<br>

If you check back to our Log Analytics Workspace ‚ûú go to the **"Agents"** blade:

‚úÖ The Agents should have already been Deployed and Successfully Installed on the Target Virtual Machines
